Acoustic source separation for the detection of coronary artery sounds
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, being responsible for more than 20% of all deaths in the country. This is in large part due to the difficulty of diagnostic screening for CAD. Phonoangiography seeks to detect CAD via the acoustic signature associated with turbulent flow near an abnormally constricted, or stenosed, region. However, the usefulness of the technique is severely hindered by the low strength of the CAD signal compared to the background noise within the chest. In this work, acoustic finite element analysis (FEA) was performed on physiologically accurate chest geometries to demonstrate the feasibility of an original acoustic source separation methodology for isolating coronary sounds. This approach is based upon pseudoinversion of mixing matrices determined through a combination of experiment and computation. This allows calculation of the sound emitted by the coronary arteries based upon measurements of the acoustic velocity on the chest surface. This work demonstrates the feasibility of such a technique computationally and examines the vulnerability of the proposed approach to measurement errors.
