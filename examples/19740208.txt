Cerebral palsy lifetime care - four musculoskeletal conditions
Cerebral palsy (CP) has always been considered a static condition in the neurological sense. Secondary and associated conditions that occur in the patient with CPcan progress over time and cause unwanted sequelae. This paper discusses four musculoskeletal conditions that present across the lifetime and can lead to progressive loss of function in the patient with CP. Patella alta can be particularly painful in the early adult years, limiting mobility particularly when associated with crouch gait. Adults with lower-extremity weight-bearing status having hip dysplasia, progressive over time, often develop pain and severe degenerative arthritis, with or without arthrodesis. Spondylolysis, particularly at the L5 S1 level, is fairly common in the ambulatory adult with diplegia and may, if not diagnosed early, progress to spondylolisthesis. Cervical stenosis appears to be more prevalent in adults with spastic quadriparesis and dystonia and is often associated with myelomalacia and/or radiculopathy. All four of these conditions may be lessened, or even prevented, with intervention and diagnosis in the younger years. Possible interventions and outcomes over time are discussed in the context of multidisciplinary team management of the individual with CP.
