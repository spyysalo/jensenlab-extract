PMID:22493142	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Ormeloxifene inhibits osteoclast differentiation in parallel to downregulating RANKL-induced ROS generation and suppressing the activation of ERK and JNK in murine RAW264.7 cells.	Ormeloxifene (Orm), a triphenylethylene compound, has been established as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that suppresses the ovariectomy-induced bone resorption in rats. However, the precise mechanism underlying the bone-preserving action of Orm remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the effect of Orm on osteoclast formation induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL) in the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. We also explored the mechanism of action of Orm by studying the RANKL-induced signaling pathways required for osteoclast differentiation. We found that Orm inhibited osteoclast formation from murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells induced by RANKL in a dose-dependent manner. Orm was able to abolish RANKL-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation and inhibited the transcriptional activation of two key RANKL-induced transcription factors namely activator protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-kappaB through mechanisms involving MAPKs. Activation of two MAPKs, i.e. ERK (MAPK1) and JNK (MAPK8), was alleviated by Orm effectively, which subsequently affected the activation of c-Jun and c-Fos, which are the essential components of the AP-1 transcription complex. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Orm potentially inhibits osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting ROS generation and thereby suppressing the activation of ERK1/2 (MAPK3/MAPK1) and JNK (MAPK8) and transcription factors (NF-kappaB and AP-1), which subsequently affect the regulation of osteoclastogenesis. These results provide a possible mechanism of action of Orm in regulating osteoclastogenesis, thereby supporting the beneficial bone-protective effects of this compound.  
PMID:9590363	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Antioxidant enzymes and fatty acid status in erythrocytes of Down's syndrome patients.	The excess of genetic information in patients with Down's syndrome (DS) produces an increase in the catalytic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD1), an antioxidant enzyme coded on chromosome 21. It has been suggested that an increase in oxidative stress in DS patients may cause adverse effects in the cell membranes through the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the cellular antioxidant system by determining the catalytic activity of the SOD1, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and glutathione reductase (GR) enzymes and the concentrations of alpha-tocopherol in red blood cells (RBCs) in a group of 72 DS patients. The profile of fatty acids in the phospholipids of RBC membranes was also evaluated. The activity of the erythrocyte antioxidant enzymes is significantly higher in the DS group than in the control group (SOD1, 635 +/- 70 U/g Hb vs 476 +/- 67 U/g Hb; CAT, 1843 +/- 250 U/g Hb vs 1482 +/- 250 U/g Hb; GPx, 23.2 +/- 5.3 U/g Hb vs 21.5 +/- 3.6 U/g Hb; and GR, 9.32 +/- 1.4 U/g Hb vs 6.9 +/- 1.3 U/g Hb, respectively). No differences were observed in RBC alpha-tocopherol concentrations between the two groups studied. Long-chain n6 PUFA (C20:3n6, C20:4n6) concentrations were increased in DS patients, suggesting enhanced delta-6-desaturase activity. The long-chain n3 PUFA (docosahexenoic acid) does not appear to be affected by increased oxidative stress, probably because of the existence of compensatory antioxidant mechanisms.  
PMID:17106326	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Outcome of a structured surveillance programme in women with a familial predisposition for breast cancer.	We aimed to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of a multi-modal surveillance programme for the early detection of familial breast cancer. Ultrasound, mammography and breast magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated in 413 women who participated in a prospective study with a median follow-up of 2.2 years (range 1-6.75 years). Of these, 49 women carried a BRCA mutation, 203 were at high and 161 at moderate risk. Breast carcinomas diagnosed within the programme were compared with 297 carcinomas previously observed in the risk group and 7894 carcinomas documented in the regional cancer registry within the same time period. Overall, 41 breast carcinomas and no interval carcinoma were detected. The detection rates averaged 107.2/1000 for mutation carriers with highest rates between 20 and 39 years of age, 45.8/1000 for high-risk women with highest rates between 40 and 49 years of age and 23.9/1000 for moderate-risk women with highest rates between 50 and 74 years of age. Overall, 82.8% of the breast carcinomas were node negative and 85.4% pre-invasive or smaller than 2 cm. In comparison, of breast carcinomas detected outside the programme only 47.8% were node negative (P=0.0005) and 43.8% pre-invasive or smaller than 2 cm (P<0.000 01). Of those gathered in the local cancer registry 55.7% were node negative (P=0.004) and 47.6% pre-invasive or smaller than 2 cm (P<0.000 01). Our data indicate that (1) there is a strong correlation between breast cancer detection rates, risk status and age at disease onset and (2) a multi-modal surveillance programme can detect early-stage hereditary breast carcinomas.

PMID:3515815	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	[Determination of the value of spectrum analysis of the Doppler signal in the assessment of the carotid artery bifurcation].	A prospective trial was set up in 100 patients, who underwent arteriography of the cerebropetal and cerebral arteries, to determine the value of the direct examination of the Carotid arteries using a continuous wave bidirectionnal Doppler with spectrum frequency analysis. The results of this non-invasive direct technique are compared with the biplane arteriography and with the indirect noninvasive oculoplethysmography (OPG-Gee). The conclusions of this study are that the direct Doppler examination with spectrum frequency-analysis is a very good tool in detecting lesions in the Carotid arteries, and is superior to the indirect OPG-Gee examination, especially in stenoses of 30-69%.  
PMID:16277173	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and metabolic diseases.	Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a gastrointestinal hormone, mainly secreted after meals, which enhances glucose-induced insulin secretion and induces satiety. It has been reported that GLP-1 levels after a mixed meal and after an oral glucose load are reduced in patients with Type 2 diabetes. The reduction of oral glucose-stimulated active GLP-1 levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes has also been observed during euglycemic iperinsulinemic clamp. The reduction of post-prandial circulating active GLP-1 in Type 2 diabetic subjects, as a consequence of chronic hyperglycemia, could contribute to the reduction of early post-prandial insulin secretion; in fact, the administration of GLP-1 receptor antagonists to healthy volunteers elicits both an impairment of meal-induced insulin secretion and an increase of post-prandial glycemia similar to that observed in Type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 is rapidly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), an enzyme produced by endothelial cells in different districts and that circulates in plasma. It is still not clear whether the reduction of mealor oral-glucose stimulated GLP-1 levels in Type 2 diabetic patients is due to impairment of secretion, increase of degradation, or both. The major limitation of using GLP-1 to treat diabetic patients is the short half-life of the native compound. There are now several compounds in various stages of pre-clinical or clinical development for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes that utilize the GLP-1 signaling pathway; these include GLP-1 receptor agonists with extended half-lives, and inhibitors of DPP-IV that increase circulating levels of endogenous, intact and bioactive GLP-1.  
PMID:27654424	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	The Antiproliferative Effect of Bevacizumab on Human Tenon Fibroblasts Is Not Mediated by Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Inhibition.	Vascular endothelial growth factor-signaling in human tenon fibroblasts (hTFs) has recently become a target for antifibrotic treatment in glaucoma filtration surgery. The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (BVC) has been shown to increase filtration bleb size. Given the relatively high concentration of BVC needed to obtain an effect, we investigated whether BVC acts through VEGF inhibition or via non-antigen-dependent ways. Human tenon fibroblast primary cultures were obtained from strabismus surgery subjects. Under low (0.2%) and high (10%) serum conditions, cells were incubated with BVC, ranibizumab (RNB), aflibercept (AFB), or rituximab (RTX) at different concentrations. Total number of cells and number of dead or proliferating (5-bromo-2-deoxy-uridine-positive) cells were assessed after 24 hours. Concentrations of VEGF-A in cell culture media was measured with ELISA. Intracellular IgG was detected with immunostaining and Western blot analysis. In quiescent hTF culture (0.2% serum) the addition of 5 mg/mL BVC induced widespread cell death. Under proliferative conditions (10% serum), BVC reduced the number of proliferating cells. No such effect was observed with 2.5 mg/mL BVC or with 10 mg/mL AFB or 2.5 mg/mL RNB, although they were equally effective in binding free VEGF-A in the culture media. Instead, the CD20 antibody RTX, which did not bind VEGF, induced hTF death and inhibited proliferation in a BVC-comparable fashion. Bevacizumab, AFB, and RTX were detected intracellularly in a concentration-dependent manner. The cell death-inducing and antiproliferative effect of 5 mg/mL BVC appeared not to depend on VEGF inhibition. Our data question a direct role of VEGF for hTF survival and proliferation.

A Gram-positive, spore-forming, aerobic actinomycete, strain Gsoil 519T, was isolated from soil of a ginseng field of Pocheon province in South Korea. The closest phylogenetic relatives were Streptomyces marinus Sp080513GE-26T (97.94 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Streptomyces albiaxialis NRRL B-24327T (97.84 %), Streptomyces albus subsp. albus DSM 40313T (97.84 %), Streptomyces almquistii NBRC 13015T (97.81 %), Streptomyces gibsonii NBRC 15415T (97.81 %), Streptomyces rangoonensis NBRC 13078T (97.81 %), Streptomyces sodiiphilus YIM 80305T (97.77 %) and Streptomyces flocculus NBRC 13041T (97.67 %). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 71.8 mol%. The chemotaxonomic data [MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8) as the major menaquinones; ll-diaminopimelic acid as a component of the cell-wall peptidoglycan; ribose, xylose, mannose and glucose as the major cell-wall sugars; and anteiso-C15:0, iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0, anteiso-C17:0 and C16:0 as the major fatty acids] supported the affiliation of strain Gsoil 519T to the genus Streptomyces. The physiological and biochemical characteristics and the low level of DNA-DNA relatedness differentiated the isolate genotypically and phenotypically from recognized members of the genus Streptomyces. The isolate, therefore, represents a novel species, for which the name Streptomyces panacagri sp. nov. is proposed, with Gsoil 519T (=KCTC 19139T=DSM 41871T) as the type strain.  
PMID:6625173	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Determination of catecholamine sulfoconjugate isomers in normal human urine by use of high-performance liquid chromatography with a photochemical detector.	A method for the determination of catecholamine sulfoconjugate isomers (CA-S) in urine was developed. The photo-induced fluorogenic reaction of CA-S with ethylenediamine reported previously was applied to the postcolumn labeling of HPLC for sensitive and selective detection. Special equipment for the reaction was made with a uv-irradiation lamp and a reaction coil of Teflon tubing inside a temperature-controlled reaction box. Lower determination limits of this system were 1 to 2 pmol. Urine samples pretreated with small ion-exchange resin columns were subjected to HPLC. Peaks corresponding to CA-S were identified quantitatively by two different separation methods. Thus, all six CA-S were first detected in the urine of normal individuals. The excretion rates of dopamine 3-sulfate, dopamine 4-sulfate, norepinephrine 3-sulfate, norepinephrine 4-sulfate, epinephrine 3-sulfate, and epinephrine 4-sulfate were 420 +/- 240, 98 +/- 55, 86 +/- 95, 15 +/- 14, 18 +/- 7, and 3 +/- 1 ng/min (+/- SD), respectively (n = 5).  
PMID:25394395	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Influence of Panax ginseng on the offspring of adult rats exposed to prenatal stress.	The exposure of pregnant females to stress during a critical period of fetal brain development is an environmental risk factor for the development of schizophrenia in adult offspring. Schizophrenia is a group of common mental disorders of unclear origin, affecting approximately 1% of the global population, showing a generally young age at onset. In the present study, a repeated variable stress paradigm was applied to pregnant rats during the final week of gestation. The effects of an extract of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (PG) on rats exposed to prenatal stress (PNS) were investigated in terms of behavioral activity and protein expression analyses. In the behavioral tests, grooming behavior in a social interaction test, line-crossing behavior in an open-field test and swimming activity in a forced-swim test were decreased in the rats exposed to PNS compared with the non-stressed offspring; the changes in behavioral activity were reversed upon oral treatment with PG (300 mg/kg). Subsequently, western blot analysis and immunohistochemical analyses of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus revealed that the downregulation of several neurodevelopmental genes which occurred following exposure to PNS was reversed upon treatment with PG. The current findings demonstrate that the downregulation of several genes following exposure to PNS may affect subsequent behavioral changes, and that these phenomena are reversed following treatment with PG during pregnancy. Our results suggest that oral treatment with PG reduces the incidence of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.  
PMID:22592575	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Radiology employees' quality of work life.	Quality of work Life (QWL) originates from interactions between employees' needs and relative organizational resources. QWL is aimed to improve and retain employees' satisfaction, productivity and effectiveness of all organizations. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 15 Tehran University of Medical Sciences. A Cross-Sectional, descriptive study was conducted among 15 Tehran University of Medical Sciences' Hospitals' Radiology Departments' Employees by QWL questionnaire. Respondents were asked to express their attitudes about a range of key factors as the most important issues impacting their QWL. The data was collected and analyzed by SPSS version 15 software. Most of the respondents indicated that they were unsatisfied and very unsatisfied with key factors of their QWL. Comparison of QWL key factors of TUMS radiology employees with the other countries indicated that most of the employees are unsatisfied with their poor QWL factors. We hope, the implications of these findings deliberate to improve QWL within each of TUMS hospitals radiology departments and also be relevant and value to policymakers of healthcare organizations in Iran.  
PMID:10972554	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Positive and negative oral contrast agents for combined abdominal and pelvic helical CT: first iodinated agent and second water.	Combined abdominal and pelvic helical computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast media was performed on 19 patients with 400 mL of diluted iodine solution 60 minutes before and 400 mL of water just before CT. The distal small bowel was opacified by the positive contrast agent, and the stomach by the negative contrast agent in all patients. The gastric contents were homogenous, and the density was a mean +/- standard deviation 2.5+/-7.3 HU. The difference between the densities of the gastric contents and of the gastric wall (mean +/- s.d. 80.8+/-20.9 HU) was statistically significant (p<.05). There were no pseudotumors. Thus our protocol, first diluted iodine solution and second water, can be used as a method for the oral administration of contrast agents for combined abdominal and pelvic helical CT with intravenous contrast media.  
PMID:24977335	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Radiofrequency pancreatic ablation and section of the main pancreatic duct does not lead to necrotizing pancreatitis.	The aim of this study was to determine whether radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the pancreas and subsequent transection of the main pancreatic duct may avoid the risk of both necrotizing pancreatitis and postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) formation. Thirty-two rats were subjected to RFA and section of the pancreas over their portal vein. Animals were killed at 3, 7, 15, and 21 days (groups 0-3, respectively). Two additional control groups (sham operation and user manipulation only, respectively) of 15 days of postoperative period were considered. Postoperative complications, histological changes (including morphometric and immunohistochemical analysis), and incidence of POPF were evaluated. A significant increase in serum amylase levels (P < 0.05) on the third postoperative day, which return to baseline levels in the following weeks, was noted in groups 0 to 3. Those groups showed a rapid atrophy of the distal pancreas by apoptosis with no signs of necrotizing pancreatitis or POPF. The distal pancreas in groups 1 to 3 compared with group 0 and control groups showed a significant increase of small islets (<1000 microm). The rapid acinar atrophy of the distal pancreas after RFA and section of the pancreatic ducts in this model does not lead to necrotizing pancreatitis.

PMID:25314403	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Ratcheting of Brownian swimmers in periodically corrugated channels: a reduced Fokker-Planck approach.	We consider the motion of self-propelling Brownian particles in two-dimensional periodically corrugated channels. The point-size swimmers propel themselves in a direction which fluctuates by Brownian rotation; in addition, they undergo Brownian motion. The impermeability of the channel boundaries in conjunction with an asymmetry of the unit-cell geometry enables ratcheting, where a nonzero particle current is animated along the channel. This effect is studied here in the continuum limit using a diffusion-advection description of the probability density in a four-dimensional position-orientation space. Specifically, the mean particle velocity is calculated using macrotransport (generalized Taylor-dispersion) theory. This description reveals that the ratcheting mechanism is indirect: swimming gives rise to a biased spatial particle distribution which in turn results in a purely diffusive net current. For a slowly varying channel geometry, the dependence of this current upon the channel geometry and fluid-particle parameters is studied via a long-wave approximation over a reduced two-dimensional space. This allows for a straightforward seminumerical solution. In the limit where both rotational diffusion and swimming are strong, we find an asymptotic approximation to the particle current, scaling inversely with the square of the swimming Peclet number. For a given swimmer-fluid system, this limit is physically realized with increasing unit-cell size.   
PMID:18825876	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Effect of inspiration/expiration on height measurement.	Growth parameters are a powerful screening tool in pediatric care. Accuracy assumes differing importance in different clinical settings. A small error is not clinically significant when height is obtained as a screening tool during annual well child visits. However, when assessing annual growth velocity using shorter interval visits, an error of equal magnitude might influence further management decisions. AIM AND HYPOTHESIS: To explore the effect of inspiration or expiration on height measurement. Our hypothesis was that height measurements obtained in inspiration would be greater than those obtained in expiration or without specific instructions as to status of respiration (unspecified). Heights of 99 individuals 8 years and older were measured in inspiration, expiration and unspecified respiratory status by two pediatric endocrinologists. Patients were measured three times in each mode. The p values were adjusted by Tukey procedure for multiple comparisons among three modes. Height measurement performed in inspiration, expiration or without specific instruction as to breathing (unspecified) did affect height measurement. Mean difference +/- SEM (95% CI) between height obtained in inspiration and expiration was 0.22 +/- 0.03 cm (95% CI: 0.15, 0.29); between inspiration and unspecified 0.31 +/- 0.04 cm (95% CI: 0.22, 0.40); and between expiration and unspecified 0.092 +/- 0.03 cm (95% CI: 0.03, 0.16). Based on these results, we recommend multiple height measurements using uniform technique including inspiratory/expiratory status, especially when calculating 'annualized' height velocity over short intervals.

Of 11 patients with untreated mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) who were studied, all had decreased circulating T gamma cells, and all but one had decreased suppressor cell function of T cells on B cells, determined by a reverse hemolytic plaque-cell assay. Results in 21 normal subjects were significantly, different. Incubation of mononuclear cells from MCTD patients in purified anti-ribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP) IgG resulted in further decrease in their suppressor function. Decrease of T gamma cells and their suppressor function may be due to in vivo penetration of anti-RNP antibody into T gamma cells, causing their deletion.  
PMID:9449436	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Concurrent blockade of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors suppresses synergistically long-term potentiation of population spikes in the rat hippocampal CA1 region.	The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist scopolamine, but not the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol or atenolol, suppressed tetanus-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of population spikes in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. When scopolamine was coapplied with propranolol or atenolol, a synergistic effect in preventing LTP generation was observed. On the other hand, the coapplication of scopolamine and atenolol failed to affect tetanus-induced LTP of field EPSP. These findings suggest that cooperative mechanisms via muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptor activation might contribute to LTP induction in terms of the EPSP-spike potentiation, i.e., an increase in the excitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells after tetanic stimulation, but are independent of the tetanus-evoked potentiation of a synaptic component.

PMID:28586824	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	The Downside of Greater Lexical Influences: Selectively Poorer Speech Perception in Noise.	Although lexical information influences phoneme perception, the extent to which reliance on lexical information enhances speech processing in challenging listening environments is unclear. We examined the extent to which individual differences in lexical influences on phonemic processing impact speech processing in maskers containing varying degrees of linguistic information (2-talker babble or pink noise). Twenty-nine monolingual English speakers were instructed to ignore the lexical status of spoken syllables (e.g., gift vs. kift) and to only categorize the initial phonemes (/g/ vs. /k/). The same participants then performed speech recognition tasks in the presence of 2-talker babble or pink noise in audio-only and audiovisual conditions. Individuals who demonstrated greater lexical influences on phonemic processing experienced greater speech processing difficulties in 2-talker babble than in pink noise. These selective difficulties were present across audio-only and audiovisual conditions. Individuals with greater reliance on lexical processes during speech perception exhibit impaired speech recognition in listening conditions in which competing talkers introduce audible linguistic interferences. Future studies should examine the locus of lexical influences/interferences on phonemic processing and speech-in-speech processing.

PMID:9853582	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Overcoming the histocompatibility barrier: transferrins as carriers and modulators of immunogenic identity.	Proteic molecules were found in the bone marrow that were later identified as transferrins. When applied to transplantation of genetically incompatible bone marrow in supralethally irradiated recipient mice, the transferrins obtained from plasma of bone marrow donors promoted engraftment, permanent hemopoietic chimerism, and donor-type immune character. A combination of donor-matched transferrins and antigens was needed for induction of xenogeneic (interspecies) "tolerance" or unresponsiveness to donor antigens in chemically immunosuppressed mice treated with human transferrins and donor leucocytes. This novel and unique property of transferrins may explain the genesis and maintenance of immunogenic identity and allow a reshaping of the immune system.  
PMID:10893354	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Thoracoscopic decortication as first-line therapy for pediatric parapneumonic empyema. A case series.	Previous articles have promoted the early use of thoracotomy and decortication for refractory empyema. This study examines thoracoscopy and decortication at the time of initial chest tube placement in pediatric patients with parapneumonic empyema. We reviewed the medical records of 16 consecutive patients who were children with parapneumonic empyema. Thirteen children (group 1) underwent thoracoscopic decortication and tube thoracostomy as their initial operative procedures; 3 children (group 2) had tube thoracostomy alone. In both groups, chest tubes were removed prior to their discharge to home. The mean (+/- SD) operative time for thoracoscopy was 81 +/- 19 min with no complications. On average, chest tubes were removed by postoperative day 4. The mean time to discharge was 8.3 days. Two children eventually required lobectomy. The mean operative time for chest tube placement alone was 21 +/- 3 min. Children required chest tube drainage for an average of 12.3 days. The mean time to discharge was 16.6 days. Two patients required a total of five additional operative procedures, including two additional chest tube placements, two open decortications, and one lobectomy. Thoracoscopic decortication is effective in the early treatment of pediatric parapneumonic empyema. It facilitates visualization, evacuation, and mechanical decortication of the pleural space with no additional morbidity and may lead to reduced time for chest tube drainage, shorter hospitalization, and more rapid clinical recovery.  
PMID:23744276	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Prognostic significance of the extent of lymph node involvement in stage II-N1 non-small cell lung cancer.	The non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) staging system (published in 2009 in the seventh edition of the cancer staging manuals of the Union for International Cancer Control and American Joint Commission on Cancer) did not include any changes to current N descriptors for NSCLC. However, the prognostic significance of the extent of lymph node (LN) involvement (including the LN zones involved [hilar/interlobar or peripheral], cancer-involved LN ratios [LNRs], and the number of involved LNs) remains unknown. The aim of this report is to evaluate the extent of LN involvement and other prognostic factors in predicting outcome after definitive surgery among Chinese patients with stage II-N1 NSCLC. We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic characteristics of 206 patients with stage II (T1a-T2bN1M0) NSCLC who had undergone complete surgical resection at Shanghai Chest Hospital from June 1999 to June 2009. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared using Kaplan-Meier statistical analysis. Stratified and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between the LN involvement and survival. Peripheral zone LN involvement, cancer-involved LNR, smaller tumor size, and squamous cell carcinoma were shown to be statistically significant indicators of higher OS and DFS by univariate analyses. Visceral pleural involvement was also shown to share a statistically significant relationship with DFS by univariate analyses. Multivariate analyses showed that tumor size and zone of LN involvement were significant predictors of OS. Zone of N1 LN, LN ratios, and tumor size were found to provide independent prognostic information in patients with stage II NSCLC. This information may be used to stratify patients into groups by risk for recurrence.  
PMID:394760	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Proteinases as probes of the structure of rat liver ribonucleoprotein particles carrying heterogeneous nuclear RNA.	Three proteolytic enzymes with different specificities produced essentially the same degradation pattern of the proteins of ribonucleoprotein particles. Proteins with apparent molecular weights of 144 000, 133 000 and 115 000 were hydrolyzed most readily which may indicate an exterior location in the ribonucleoprotein complex. The major particle proteins in the range of 30 000-42 000 daltons were much less susceptible to proteinases than the high molecular weight species. Proteins of 31 000, 33 000 and 42 000 daltons were resistant to proteolysis. The degradation rates of the proteins in intact ribonucleoprotein particles were considerably lower than rates obtained with the same proteins separated from the RNA. Incubation with trypsin and recentrifugation of polyparticles led to a shift in the sedimentation constant from 90 S to 0-20 S, corresponding to a decrease in the protein to RNA ratio from 4 to 1.3. No significant change in the small molecular weight RNA pattern was detected after trypsin digestion.

PMID:2549294	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Micromolar aluminum levels reduce 3H-thymidine incorporation by cell line UMR 106-01.	Aluminum-induced osteomalacia is a frequent complication observed in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. However, it is not known whether there are direct effects of aluminum on osteoblasts, or alternatively, whether the observed changes are due to changes in PTH or other factors. We sought to determine the effect of micromolar levels of aluminum on osteoblasts using a well-defined cell line derived from a 32P induced osteosarcoma of rat, UMR 106-01, which is alkaline-phosphatase positive, responds to PTH, and synthesizes type I collagen. Aluminum exposure was controlled using tissue culture media with [Al ] less than 1 microgram/liter (40 nM), produced by precipitation of aluminum salts at pH 8.5. The effect of defined [Al ], from 20 to 800 micrograms/liter (0.7 to 30 microM), was then determined by adding back aluminum while measuring DNA and protein synthesis. We found that aluminum depressed DNA synthesis, as determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation, by 60%, with half maximal effect at 20 micrograms/liter (740 nM) in cells at a density of 20,000/cm2. Alternatively, protein synthesis, as determined by 3H-leucine incorporation, did not decline, and in some cases increased. However, qualitative analysis of matrix proteins produced with and without 800 micrograms/liter (30 mM) [Al ] showed no differences. Direct measurements of cell number and protein synthesis confirmed these findings. Al does not alter the PTH-induced cAMP response of these cells. Thus, aluminum has a direct effect on cell division, and probably on protein synthesis, in this osteoblast-like cell line. These effects occur at levels of aluminum below those commonly contaminating tissue culture media, and thus are seen reproducibly only in media of defined [Al ].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

PMID:23940603	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Metabolomics reveals the heterogeneous secretome of two entomopathogenic fungi to ex vivo cultured insect tissues.	Fungal entomopathogens rely on cellular heterogeneity during the different stages of insect host infection. Their pathogenicity is exhibited through the secretion of secondary metabolites, which implies that the infection life history of this group of environmentally important fungi can be revealed using metabolomics. Here metabolomic analysis in combination with ex vivo insect tissue culturing shows that two generalist isolates of the genus Metarhizium and Beauveria, commonly used as biological pesticides, employ significantly different arrays of secondary metabolites during infectious and saprophytic growth. It also reveals that both fungi exhibit tissue specific strategies by a distinguishable metabolite secretion on the insect tissues tested in this study. In addition to showing the important heterogeneous nature of these two entomopathogens, this study also resulted in the discovery of several novel destruxins and beauverolides that have not been described before, most likely because previous surveys did not use insect tissues as a culturing system. While Beauveria secreted these cyclic depsipeptides when encountering live insect tissues, Metarhizium employed them primarily on dead tissue. This implies that, while these fungi employ comparable strategies when it comes to entomopathogenesis, there are most certainly significant differences at the molecular level that deserve to be studied.

PMID:15095032	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Functional characterization of large conductance calcium-activated K+ channel openers in bladder and vascular smooth muscle.	Calcium activated K(+) channels (K(Ca) channels) are found in a variety of smooth muscle tissues, the most characterized of which are the large conductance K(Ca) channels (BK(Ca) or maxi-K(+) channels). Recent medicinal chemistry efforts have identified novel BK(Ca) openers including 2-amino-5-(2-fluoro-phenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile (NS-8), BMS-204352 and its analog 3-(5-chloro-2-hydroxy-phenyl)-3-hydroxy-6-trifluoromethyl-1,3-dihydro-indol-2-one (compound 1), and 5,7-dichloro-4-(5-chloro-2-hydroxy-phenyl)-3-hydroxy-1H-quinolin-2-one (compound 2). Although these compounds are effective BK(Ca) openers as shown by electrophysiological methods, little is known about their effects on smooth muscle contractility. In this study, the responsiveness of structurally diverse BK(Ca) openers-NS-8, compounds 1 and 2 and the well characterized nonselective NS-1619-was assessed using segments of endothelium denuded rat aorta, rat and guinea pig detrusor precontracted with extracellular K(+), and Landrace pig detrusor stimulated by electrical field. In all preparations, the compounds tested inhibited or completely abolished contractions with similar potencies (-logIC(50) values: 3.8 to 5.1). In rat aorta, in the presence of 80 mM K(+), the compounds significantly shifted the concentration-response curve to the right compared with those obtained in 30 mM K(+). These data are consistent with K(+) channel (BK(Ca) channel) activation as the underlying mechanism of relaxation by compounds that share the electrophysiological property of BK(Ca) current activation. The similar potencies at detrusor and vascular smooth muscle suggest that the achievement of smooth muscle selectivity in vitro with the representative compounds examined in this study may prove to be a challenge when targeting BK(Ca) channels for smooth muscle indications such as overactive bladder.  
PMID:19090945	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Improvement of chronic pain by treatment of erectile dysfunction.	Pain specialists, who do not routinely examine patients regarding their sexual medicine problems, need to be aware that sexual problems can and do aggravate the patient's pain. Patients may refuse to admit suffering from erectile dysfunction (ED) but complain about continuous or progressive severe pain. These patients may be best managed by the combined team effort of a sexual medicine specialist and pain specialist. This report documents the management of three cases with long-term intractable pain after severe trauma. Treatment of occult ED led to significant improvement of their pain. The association of the treatment of uncovered ED and improvement of chronic severe pain. Three case reports of patients with severe pain who attended a pain clinic in an academic medical center. Three men suffering from chronic pain due to severe trauma were observed for several years by different physicians as well as pain specialists. In spite of different treatments, including administration of several analgesics, psychotherapy, and physical therapy, pain was not alleviated. After finding ED problems, patients were referred to the family health clinic. Using different therapies such as psychosexual therapy, correction of sexual misconceptions, relaxation training, treatment of interpersonal difficulties, and pharmacological intervention ED was cured. Treatment of ED was accompanied by a significant reduction of chronic pain in all three patients. The present report indicates that uncovered ED in patients suffering from chronic pain may trigger their somatic pain or reduce its threshold. Significant improvement in sexual functioning may improve the pain and reduce its complications.

Increased patient loads, time pressures, and heightened public awareness of medical errors are forcing many physicians and clinical administrators to consider acquiring computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems and clinical information systems. The recent revelation that CPOE systems can facilitate medical errors, however, is a call to physicians to remain vigilant despite the new technologies. By attending to specific data-capture and data-access errors associated with clinical information systems, physicians can minimize errors associated with clinical information systems and maximize the potential benefits to their patients.  
PMID:29038439	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Analysis of Nkx3.1:Cre-driven Erk5 deletion reveals a profound spinal deformity which is linked to increased osteoclast activity.	Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 5 (ERK5) has been implicated during development and carcinogenesis. Nkx3.1-mediated Cre expression is a useful strategy to genetically manipulate the mouse prostate. While grossly normal at birth, we observed an unexpected phenotype of spinal protrusion in Nkx3.1:Cre;Erk5 fl/fl (Erk5 fl/fl) mice by ~6-8 weeks of age. X-ray, histological and micro CT (microCT) analyses showed that 100% of male and female Erk5 fl/fl mice had a severely deformed curved thoracic spine, with an associated loss of trabecular bone volume. Although sex-specific differences were observed, histomorphometry measurements revealed that both bone resorption and bone formation parameters were increased in male Erk5 fl/fl mice compared to wild type (WT) littermates. Osteopenia occurs where the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation, so we investigated the role of the osteoclast compartment. We found that treatment of RANKL-stimulated primary bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) cultures with small molecule ERK5 pathway inhibitors increased osteoclast numbers. Furthermore, osteoclast numbers and expression of osteoclast marker genes were increased in parallel with reduced Erk5 expression in cultures generated from Erk5 fl/fl mice compared to WT mice. Collectively, these results reveal a novel role for Erk5 during bone maturation and homeostasis in vivo.

PMID:21112351	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Effects of T-type calcium channel blockers on a parkinsonian tremor model in rats.	T-type calcium channels are strongly associated with the generation of rhythmic firing patterns in the CNS. Blockers of these channels may have therapeutic potential for treating various types of tremor. The present study aimed to study the effects of a range of T-type calcium channel blockers in a parkinsonian tremor model in rats. We tested the effects of several T-type calcium channel blockers, including zonisamide (ZNS), ethosuximide, lomerizine, amiloride, mibefradil, and NCC 55-0396, a mibefradil derivative, on tacrine-induced tremulous jaw movements (TJMs), an animal model of parkinsonian tremor. Among the tested drugs, only ZNS and NCC 55-0396 significantly suppressed TJMs when given at a non-sedating dose. The transitivity of drugs to the central nervous system (CNS) may at least partially explain their differential anti-TJM effects. However, further studies are necessary to reveal other factors, since ethosuximide failed to show anti-TJM effects despite being known to cross the blood brain barrier. The present results suggest that T-type calcium channels in the CNS may be a suitable target for developing new therapeutic strategies for treating parkinsonian tremor.  
PMID:18770820	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Multiplexed SNP genotyping using primer single-base extension (SBE) and microsphere arrays.	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genome sites with single-base sequence differences between individual chromosomes, are the most common type of genetic variation. Single-base changes can result in disease phenotypes, confer susceptibility or resistance to toxins or pathogens, or serve as markers for distinct allelic segments of DNA, making SNPs an important emerging tool in both basic and clinical research. This unit presents detailed protocols for multiplexed SNP genotyping using primer single-base extension (SBE) adapted to microspheres and flow cytometry. The methods described are best suited for typing a modest number of SNPs in a large number of samples. The Basic Protocol describes extension of the genotyping primers by one nucleotide, a labeled dideoxyribonucleotide that reveals the nucleotide base at that position on the template strand. The extended primers are then captured onto microspheres bearing an oligonucleotide "address" that is the reverse complement of a sequence on the 5' end of the genotyping primers and subsequently measured using flow cytometry.  
PMID:21735122	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Evaluation of natural and nitramine binding energies to 3-D models of the S1S2 domains in the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.	Overactivation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in postsynaptic neurons leads to glutamate-related excitotoxicity in the central nervous system of mammals. We have built 3-D models of each domain for the universal screening of potential toxicants and their binding mechanisms. Our docking results show that the calculated pK (i) values of glycine and L: -glutamate significantly increase (>1) when the NR1 and NR2A S1S2 domains are closing, respectively. Inversely, D: -cycloserine (DCS) and 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (5,7-DCKA) do not show such a dependence on domain closure. Replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) confirmed 5 different conformational states of the S1S2 domain along the 308.2 K temperature trajectory. Analysis of residue fluctuations during this temperature trajectory showed that residues in loop 1, loop 2, the amino terminal domain (ATD), and the area linked to ion channel alpha-helices are involved in this movement. This further implicates the notion that efficacious ligands act through S1S2 lobe movement which can culminate in the opening or closing of the ion channel. We further tested this by docking hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX) to the S1S2 domain. Our results predict that these nitramines are not efficacious and thus do not produce excitoxicity when they bind to the S1S2 domain of the NMDAR.

PMID:23213319	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Antioxidant Stress and Anti-Inflammation of PPARalpha on Warm Hepatic Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury.	Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a serious clinical problem. Minimizing the adverse effect of ischemia-reperfusion injury after liver surgery or trauma is an urgent need. It has been proved that besides the effect of regulating the lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, PPARalpha also undertakes the task of organ protection. In this paper, related literature has been summarized and we come to the conclusion that administration of PPARalpha agonists can strengthen the antioxidant and anti-inflammation defense system by the upregulation of the expression of antioxidant enzymes and inhibition of NF-kappaB activity. This may provide a potential clinical treatment for hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury.

This study evaluated the influence of the surface treatments of fiberglass posts on bond strength to root dentin using push-out test. Forty bovine incisor roots were endodontically treated. The surface of the fiberglass posts (Exacto #2, Angelus) were treated using 4 different protocols (n=10): Control - 70% ethanol for 1 min; 37% phosphoric acid for 1 min; 10% hydrofluoric acid for 1 min; and 24% hydrogen peroxide for 1 min. After a silane coupling agent was applied for 1 min and all posts were cemented using self-adhesive resin cement (RelyX Unicem, 3M-ESPE). The roots were sectioned and two 1-mm-thick slices were obtained from each third: cervical, middle and apical. The specimens were subjected to the push-out test with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Data were analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD tests (=0.05). The surface treatment (p<0.001) and root third region (p=0.007) factors were significant. The retention to root canal was affected by surface treatment type. The post surface treatment with 24% hydrogen peroxide for 1 min yielded significantly higher bond strength when the fiberglass posts were cemented with RelyX Unicem.   
PMID:3947105	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	[Studies on adequate intervals of cisplatin administration to ameliorate cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity].	Experimental studies were designed in order to ameliorate cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Cisplatin was injected intravenously into DS mice at a dose of 5.0 mg/kg. Plasma platinum levels declined in a biphasic fashion and were undetectable after 5 days post-infusion. Renal platinum levels decreased in the same manner as the plasma levels and revealed detectable plateau levels 5 days after single injection. Cisplatin was administer once a week for 3 consecutive weeks; serial plasma and renal platinum levels and BUN were measured 7 days after each injection. The results showed that there was no significant change in the levels of plasma platinum and BUN but that the renal platinum levels increased progressively (1.6 +/- 0.3, 3.1 +/- 0.4, 4.8 +/- 2.7 micrograms/g wet wt.). After another 6 successive weeks of cisplatin administration, 55% of mice died. The renal platinum levels and BUN of the survivors were highly increased. The renal tissue revealed histologically acute renal failure. However the renal concentration of platinum was decreased to a low level of 1.1 +/- 0.4 micrograms/g wet wt. 4 weeks after the third injection. These results suggested that cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity could be ameliorated by adequate intervals of cisplatin administration.  
PMID:19198529	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Rapid detection of Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi in mosquito vectors (Diptera: Culicidae) using a real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer multiplex PCR and melting curve analysis.	We developed a single-step real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) merged with melting curve analysis for the detection of Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi DNA in blood-fed mosquitoes. Real-time FRET multiplex PCR is based on fluorescence melting curve analysis of a hybrid of amplicons generated from two families of repeated DNA elements: the 188 bp SspI repeated sequence, specific to W. bancrofti, and the 153-bp HhaI repeated sequence, specific to the genus Brugia and two pairs of specific fluorophore-labeled probes. Both W. bancrofti and B. malayi can be differentially detected in infected vectors by this process through their different fluorescence channel and melting temperatures. The assay could distinguish both human filarial DNAs in infected vectors from the DNAs of Dirofilaria immitis- and Plasmodium falciparum-infected human red blood cells and noninfected mosquitoes and human leukocytes. The technique showed 100% sensitivity and specificity and offers a rapid and reliable procedure for differentially identifying lymphatic filariasis. The introduced real-time FRET multiplex PCR can reduce labor time and reagent costs and is not prone to carry over contamination. The test can be used to screen mosquito vectors in endemic areas and therefore should be a useful diagnostic tool for the evaluation of infection rate of the mosquito populations and for xenomonitoring in the community after eradication programs such as the Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis.  
PMID:2382175	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	A prospective study of long-term use of amikacin in a paediatrics department. Indications, administration, side-effects, bacterial isolates and resistance.	Amikacin (Amikin; B-M) was used as the only aminoglycoside for 18 months in a paediatric department within a general hospital because of high levels of resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae isolates to tobramycin, gentamicin and netilmicin. Between 1 February 1987 and 31 July 1988, 816 children were treated with a slow intravenous injection at a standardised dose adjusted for weight and age. Respiratory disease was present in 35.8% of 537 neonates, 56.4% of 190 infants and 70.9% of 89 older children. Escherichia coli (65 isolates), Klebsiella species (59 isolates), Enterobacter species (26 isolates) and P. aeruginosa (22 isolates) constituted the most common Gram-negative pathogens. The positive blood culture yield was 7.8%. Satisfactory median peak and trough serum amikacin levels were achieved. No significant renal side-effects were noted. Severe bilateral hearing loss in 1 low-birthweight infant resulted from inadvertent overdosage. At the end of this 18-month surveillance period 97.7% of E. coli, 98.6% of K. pneumoniae, 96.3% of E. cloacae, and 98.0% of P. aeruginosa isolates remained sensitive to amikacin, while resistance of K. pneumoniae to tobramycin, netilmicin and gentamicin decreased significantly (P less than 0.003, P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.007 respectively; chi-square test).  
PMID:17430157	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Drug resistance in hepatoblastoma.	Treatment results of human hepatoblastoma (HB) have been improved remarkably during recent years, mainly through the establishment of integrated regimens controlled and coordinated by multicentric treatment studies. Today, neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy is combined with surgical resection of the tumors. The main therapeutic goal is a complete surgical removal of tumor masses, which is also essential for the survival of the patients. Despite improved overall survival rates, treatment results of advanced tumors are still far from being satisfying. Multidrug resistance has been identified as a major factor responsible for the bad prognosis of children suffering from advanced staged hepatoblastoma. During recent years investigations focused on factors contributing to drug resistance in hepatoblastoma and on possible approaches towards overcoming this therapeutical challenge. Alternative approaches that are currently evaluated in experimental and clinical settings comprise new cytotoxic agents, chemosensitizers, gene directed applications but also surgical techniques and an expansion of indication for liver transplantation.

PMID:30660893	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Transvenous treatment of carotid aneurysms through transseptal access.	Transseptal puncture has been widely used by cardiologists to reach the left side of the heart through a transvenous access. Rarely, it can also be used to pass into the supraaortic arteries from the venous side when conventional transarterial access pathways (transfemoral, transradial/brachial routes or direct carotid puncture) are likely to fail. We report two cases of transvenous femoral access followed by transseptal access to aorta to treat dissecting carotid artery aneurysms at the level of the skull base with flow diverters. In one case, multiple cervical arterial bypass operations and in the other, a rare anomaly of the aortic arch precluded endovascular treatment through conventional routes. Transvenous-transseptal access enabled treatment of both cases easily and without complications. On follow-up CT angiogram both flow diverters were patent, there were no residual aneurysms and no neurologic or cardiac adverse events in both patients.

PMID:1810681	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	The prognostic and economic implications of a strategy to detect and treat asymptomatic ischemia: the Atenolol Silent Ischemia Trial (ASIST) protocol.	Although silent ischemia may be linked to increases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the long-term effects of a strategy aimed at the detection and treatment of this asymptomatic condition have not been fully explored. We therefore have developed the Atenolol Silent Ischemia Trial (ASIST), the first multicenter, randomized, prospective study of the prognostic implications of silent ischemia in asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease. Inclusion criteria for study patients were documented coronary artery disease, evidenced angiographically or by previous myocardial infarction, and transient ischemia, evidenced by abnormalities of regional wall motion, stress thallium-201, or exercise electrocardiogram. The main objective of ASIST is to assess the influence of frequency and duration of symptomatic and asymptomatic ischemic episodes on the occurrence of fatal and nonfatal cardiac events. Atenolol, a beta 1-selective adrenergic blocker, was chosen as the therapeutic intervention because of its potential benefits in treating both symptomatic and asymptomatic ischemia. Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring will be used to measure the frequency and duration of ischemic episodes during daily life. The predictive ability of short-term (4-week) effects on long-term (52-week) response to atenolol treatment is also being assessed, along with the economic impact of this diagnostic and therapeutic strategy. Given the current emphasis on reducing morbidity and mortality associated with coronary artery disease, ASIST results should shed light onto the long-term management and prognostic implications of this otherwise asymptomatic condition.  
PMID:21570317	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	EMG analysis tuned for determining the timing and level of activation in different motor units.	Recruitment patterns and activation dynamics of different motor units greatly influence the temporal pattern and magnitude of muscle force development, yet these features are not often considered in muscle models. The purpose of this study was to characterize the recruitment and activation dynamics of slow and fast motor units from electromyographic (EMG) recordings and twitch force profiles recorded directly from animal muscles. EMG and force data from the gastrocnemius muscles of seven goats were recorded during in vivo tendon-tap reflex and in situ nerve stimulation experiments. These experiments elicited EMG signals with significant differences in frequency content (p<0.001). The frequency content was characterized using wavelet and principal components analysis, and optimized wavelets with centre frequencies, 149.94 Hz and 323.13 Hz, were obtained. The optimized wavelets were used to calculate the EMG intensities and, with the reconstructed twitch force profiles, to derive transfer functions for slow and fast motor units that estimate the activation state of the muscle from the EMG signal. The resulting activation-deactivation time constants gave r values of 0.98-0.99 between the activation state and the force profiles. This work establishes a framework for developing improved muscle models that consider the intrinsic properties of slow and fast fibres within a mixed muscle, and that can more accurately predict muscle force output from EMG.

PMID:8713730	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Changes in thoracic dimensions induced by breathing movements in fetal sheep.	The dimensions of the three major axes of the thorax (longitudinal, transverse and antero-posterior) were monitored in utero from the ultrasonic transit-time between pairs of piezo-electric transducers chronically implanted at opposite sides of the thorax in five fetal sheep at 119-122 days of gestation; tracheal and vascular catheters and diaphragmatic EMG electrodes were also implanted. To measure thoracic length, ultrasound transducers were implanted on the diaphragm and over the upper sternum and manubrium sterni. A pair was implanted on opposite sides of the chest to measure thoracic width, and another pair was implanted over the lower thoracic spine and lower sternum (antero-posterior dimension). The width of the thorax either decreased (mean 0.6 +/- 0.2 mm) or increased (mean 0.7 +/- 0.1 mm) during fetal breathing movements (FBM). The depth of the thorax (antero-posterior dimension) usually decreased (mean 0.9 +/- 0.1 mm) during FBM. The distance between the upper sternum and the diaphragm decreased by 1.0 +/- 0.1 mm (left side) and 1.6 +/- 0.3 mm (right side) during inspiratory efforts. The distance between the upper thorax and a fixed point on the lower thoracic spine decreased by a similar amount. Overall, fetal thoracic dimensions changed by 1-3%. The largest changes measured, and the most surprising, were reductions, rather than increases, in the separation between the dome of the diaphragm and the upper thorax; this suggests that, during inspiratory efforts, the upper thorax moves caudally by a greater distance than the diaphragm. FBM induce complex and variable changes in thoracic dimensions; these are likely to induce small alterations in the shape of the lungs that may act as a stimulus to lung growth.

The purpose of the current study was to quantify the potential relationship between various cytokines and peripheral nerve function in humans, in-vivo. Measures of nerve conduction velocity (NCV) were examined prior to and following the induction of a cytokine spike. A significant negative correlation was found between the change in IL-1ra and the change in NCV at 24h post-exercise (r=-0.65, p=0.02) while a significant positive correlation was found between the change in IL-6 and the change in NCV at 2h post-exercise (r=0.61, p=0.048). It may be possible that different cytokines induce a unique neural influence at elevated concentrations.   
PMID:12691454	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Selective sentinel lymphadenectomy for malignant melanoma.	To date, selective sentinel lymphadenectomy (SSL) should be considered a standard approach for staging patients with primary invasive melanoma greater than or equal to 1 mm. It is imperative that the multidisciplinary team master the techniques of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, intraoperative lymphatic mapping, and postoperative pathologic evaluation of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). A SLN is defined as a blue, "hot", or any subsequent lymph node greater than 10% of the in vivo count of the hottest lymph node and as an enlarged or indurated lymph node. Frozen sections are not recommended. For extremity melanoma, delayed SSL may be performed. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy for extremity melanoma may be done the night before so that surgery can be scheduled as the first case of the following day. Every surgeon who uses blue dye should be cognizant of the potential adverse reaction to isosulfan blue and treatment for such a potential fatal reaction. A complete lymph node dissection is done if the SLN is found to be positive. Elective lymph node dissection should not be done if SSL can be done as a staging procedure. It is important for investigators involved with SSL to follow the clinical outcome of their patients so that the role of SSL can be further defined.

Mitral valve surgery is the gold standard therapy for severe mitral regurgitation, but can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Percutaneous mitral leaflet repair has recently been established as a viable alternative to surgery, but many patients are ineligible and repair may not be optimal. Transcatheter mitral valve implantation may be an alternate therapeutic option, particularly for high-risk patients. We outline the initial preclinical and first-in-human experience with the Tiara transapical mitral valve implantation system, highlighting the ease of implantation, proven feasibility and excellent haemodynamic performance.

PMID:10560626	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Development of special hyphal branches of Phyllactinia corylea on host and non-host surfaces	Hyphae of Phyllactinia corylea produce two kinds of special branches on the host surface: adhesion bodies which serve as fungal attachment and stomatopodia which enter the leaf through stomata. Conidial germination on host and non-host surfaces was examined with a scanning electron microscope to explain the stimuli responsible for development of the special branches, and the involvement of host recognition in the process. Conidia germinated within 4 h on host and non-host surfaces, but on non-host surfaces the emergence of the germ tube was not always directed towards the substratum. Adhesion bodies were formed from the tips of germ tubes at the first contact point on host and non-host surfaces. Development of stomatopodia was more specific and they were formed precisely over stomata on the host surface. Stomatopodia-like structures were occasionally formed over finely ridged leaf veins on the host surface and over some fine scratches on synthetic surfaces. The experiments showed that while conidial germination and development of adhesion bodies are in response to contact stimuli, the development of stomatopodia is a response to precise topographical signals, and the directional emergence and attached growth of germ tubes involve host recognition.  
PMID:28942909	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	A Systematic Review of Exercise Systematic Reviews in the Cancer Literature (2005-2017).	Evidence supports the benefits of exercise for patients with cancer; however, specific guidance for clinical decision making regarding exercise timing, frequency, duration, and intensity is lacking. Efforts are needed to optimize clinical recommendations for exercise in the cancer population. To aggregate information regarding the benefit of exercise through a systematic review of existing systematic reviews in the cancer exercise literature. PubMed, CINAHL Plus, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the impact of movement-based exercise on the adult cancer population. Two author teams reviewed 302 abstracts for inclusion with 93 selected for full-text review. A total of 53 studies were analyzed. A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) was used as a quality measure of the reviews. Information was extracted using the PICO format (ie, participants, intervention, comparison, outcomes). Descriptive findings are reported. Mean AMSTAR score = 7.66/11 (+/-2.04) suggests moderate quality of the systematic reviews. Exercise is beneficial before, during, and after cancer treatment, across all cancer types, and for a variety of cancer-related impairments. Moderate-to-vigorous exercise is the best level of exercise intensity to improve physical function and mitigate cancer-related impairments. Therapeutic exercises are beneficial to manage treatment side effects, may enhance tolerance to cancer treatments, and improve functional outcomes. Supervised exercise yielded superior benefits versus unsupervised. Serious adverse events were not common. Movement-based exercise intervention outcomes are reported. No analysis of pooled effects was calculated across reviews due to significant heterogeneity within the systematic reviews. Findings do not consider exercise in advanced cancers or pediatric populations. Exercise promotes significant improvements in clinical, functional, and in some populations, survival outcomes and can be recommended regardless of the type of cancer. Although generally safe, patients should be screened and appropriate precautions taken. Efforts to strengthen uniformity in clinical trial reporting, develop clinical practice guidelines, and integrate exercise and rehabilitation services into the cancer delivery system are needed.  
PMID:30318428	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Age-related changes in axial and sagittal orientation of the facet joints: Comparison with changes in degenerative spondylolisthesis.	Despite facet joints being three-dimensional structures, previous computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies have evaluated facet joint orientation in only the axial plane. Facet joint orientation in the sagittal plane has rarely been studied using these imaging techniques. The aim of this study was to elucidate facet joint orientation in both the axial and sagittal planes on computed tomography. A total of 568 patients (343 men, 225 women) (excluding orthopedic outpatients) for whom abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scans were obtained at our hospital between September 2010 and October 2012 were included. Mean age was 63 (range 21-90) years. Patients were divided into a degenerative spondylolisthesis group (67 patients; 30 men, 37 women) and a control group (313 patients; 313 men, 188 women). Facet joint orientation was evaluated in the control group according to patient age (<=50, 51-60, 61-70, or >=71 years). The findings in the control group were then compared with those in the degenerative spondylolisthesis group. The orientation of the lumbar facet joints at each level was measured in the axial and sagittal planes on computed tomography images. Facet joint angles decreased with age at L4/5 and L5/S1 in women in the axial plane and at L4/5 in men and L3/4 and L4/5 in women in the sagittal plane. The variation in facet joint angle was greatest at L4/5 in women. Patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis showed more sagittally and horizontally oriented facet joints in the axial and sagittal planes; facet tropism showed an association with degenerative spondylolisthesis in the axial plane. The axial and sagittal orientation of facet joints in the lower lumbar vertebra, especially L4/5, was negatively correlated with age. This finding could help to explain why older people are more prone to degenerative spondylolisthesis.  
PMID:1536829	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Parallel processes within the 'spot-light' of attention.	Human ability to identify simultaneously two targets in the visual field is severely limited. Previous studies have shown that orientation identification of two targets takes twice the time needed for one target. Here we asked whether this seriality is imposed by the decision requirement of the task or by such stimulus properties as target spatial separation and similarity. Observers had to identify the orientations (vertical vs horizontal) of two Gabor patches presented at random positions. Performance on this double-task experiment was compared with performance on each of the tasks when carried out alone. We varied the spatial separation between the two targets for targets having identical or different spatial-frequencies and found that the orientation of two targets having different frequencies could be identified in parallel when occupying the same spatial position but not when separated in space by 4 deg of visual angle or more. Targets having the same frequency could be identified in parallel even when separated by 8 deg, demonstrating that decision factors do not impose seriality. This result can be taken as evidence for the existence of a grouping process operating prior to orientation identification. This grouping process operates according to classical Gestalt rules (proximity, similarity) and enables parallel attentive processing of large input chunks.  
PMID:25597459	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	The nature of communication throughout diagnosis and management planning in initial audiologic rehabilitation consultations.	Effective practitioner-patient communication throughout diagnosis and management planning positively influences patient outcomes. A patient-centered approach whereby patient involvement in decision making is facilitated, a therapeutic relationship is developed, and information is bilaterally exchanged in an appropriate manner, leads to improved patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment, and self-management. Despite this knowledge, little is known about the nature of audiologist-patient communication throughout diagnosis and management planning. This research aimed to explore verbal communication between audiologists and patients/companions throughout diagnosis and management planning in initial audiology consultations. Specifically, this study aimed to describe the nature and dynamics of communication by examining the number, proportion, and type of verbal utterances by all speakers (audiologist, patient, and companion when present). In addition, this study aimed to investigate the influence of audiologist, patient, and consultation factors, such as verbal dominance, content balance, and communication control, on the dynamics of communication. A total of 62 initial audiological rehabilitation consultations (involving 26 different audiologists) were filmed and analyzed using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. All patients were older than 55 yr, and a companion was present in 17 consultations. This study focused solely on the communication relating to diagnosis and management planning (referred to as the "counseling phase"). Diagnosis, recommendations, rehabilitation options, and patient decisions were recorded along with the communication profiles and communication dynamics measured using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. Associations between communication dynamics (content balance, communication control, and verbal dominance) and eight variables were evaluated with Linear Mixed Model methods. The mean length of time for diagnosis and management planning was 29.0 min (range, 2.2-78.5 min). Communication profiles revealed that patient-centered communication was infrequently observed. First, opportunities to build a relationship were missed, such that patients' psychosocial concerns were rarely addressed and patients/companions showed little involvement in management planning. Second, the amount of talk was asymmetrical and the majority of audiologists' education and counseling utterances related to hearing aids; yet, only 56% of patients decided to obtain hearing aids at the conclusion of the consultation. Hearing aids were recommended in 83% of consultations where a hearing loss was diagnosed and alternative options were rarely provided. Thus, shared decision making rarely occurred, and audiologists often diagnosed a hearing loss and recommended hearing aids without patient involvement. In addition, when a greater proportion of time was dedicated to diagnosis and management planning, patients had greater input and control by asking more questions and requesting further information. Patient-centered communication was rarely observed in the 62 consultations. Thus, although not measured in this study, patient outcomes are likely to be affected. Future research should examine the influence of audiologist communication on outcomes and encourage a shift toward patient-centered audiological rehabilitation.

PMID:7654055	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Urinary excretion of deoxypyridinoline in patients with breast cancer.	Deoxypyridinoline (Dpyr), a crosslink of collagen molecules found in bone and excreted in urine during bone degradation, was measured in patients with breast cancer. Four groups of patients included, 42 premenopausal (32 without and 10 with bone metastases) and 65 postmenopausal (39 without and 26 with bone metastases) women. For comparison, 21 healthy women were studied. Dpyr was measured in urine samples using an enzyme immunoassay. Breast cancer patients showed elevated levels of Dpyr, irrespective of whether or not they had bone metastases. Dpyr excretion was more increased in postmenopausal patients with bone metastases. The results reflect an important bone turnover in breast cancer. The data suggest that Dpyr assay seems promising to evaluate the rate of bone loss and the response to treatment in bone metastases.  
PMID:25395791	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	A comparison of hand wrist bone analysis with two different cervical vertebral analysis in measuring skeletal maturation.	Skeletal maturation is an integral part of individual pattern of growth and development and is a continuous process. Peak growth velocity in standing height is the most valid representation of the rate of overall skeletal growth. Ossification changes of hand wrist and cervical vertebrae are the reliable indicators of growth status of individual. The objective of this study was to compare skeletal maturation as measured by hand wrist bone analysis and cervical vertebral analysis. Hand wrist radiographs and lateral cephalograms of 72 subjects aged between 7 and 16 years both male and female from the patients visiting Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, R.V. Dental College and Hospital. The 9 stages were reduced to 5 stages to compare with cervical vertebral maturation stage by Baccetti et al. The Bjork, Grave and Brown stages were reduced to six intervals to compare with cervical vertebral maturational index (CVMI) staging by Hassel and Farman. These measurements were then compared with the hand wrist bone analysis, and the results were statistically analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. There was no significant difference between the hand wrist analysis and the two different cervical vertebral analyses for assessing skeletal maturation. There was no significant difference between the two cervical vertebral analyses, but the CVMI method, which is visual method is less time consuming. Vertebral analysis on a lateral cephalogram is as valid as the hand wrist bone analysis with the advantage of reducing the radiation exposure of growing subjects.  
PMID:22332720	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Cerebral blood flow and fMRI BOLD auditory language activation in temporal lobe epilepsy.	Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), an important research and clinical tool, depends on relatively greater transient increases in (regional cerebral blood flow) rCBF than cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen during neural activity. We investigated whether reduced resting rCBF in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy affects BOLD signal during fMRI language mapping. We used [(15)O] water positron emission tomography (PET) to measure rCBF, and 3 Tesla echo planar imaging (EPI) BOLD fMRI with an auditory description decision task in 33 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (16 men; mean age 33.6 +/- standard deviation [SD] 10.6 years; epilepsy onset 14.8 +/- 10.6 years; mean duration 18.8 +/- 13.2 years; 23 left focus, 10 right focus). Anatomic regions drawn on structural MRI, based on the Wake Forest Pick Atlas, included Wernicke's area (WA), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and hippocampus (HC). Laterality indices (LIs), and asymmetry indices (AIs), were calculated on coregistered fMRI and PET. Twelve patients had mesial temporal sclerosis (seven on the left), two patients had a tumor or malformation of cortical development (both left), one patient a right temporal cyst, and 18 patients had normal MRI (14 left). Decreasing relative left WA CBF correlated with decreased left IFG voxel activation and decreasing left IFG LI. However, CBF WA AI was not related to left WA voxel activation itself or WA LI. There was a weak positive correlation between absolute CBF and fMRI activation in left IFG, right IFG, and left WA. Patients with normal and abnormal MRI did not differ in fMRI activation or rCBF AIs. Reduced WA rCBF is associated with reduced fMRI activation in IFG but not WA itself, suggesting distributed network effects, but not impairment of underlying BOLD response. Hypoperfusion in TLE does not affect fMRI clinical value.

PMID:14507354	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript: distribution and function in rat gastrointestinal tract.	Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide, originally isolated from brain, is also expressed in the peripheral nervous system. The distribution, origin and projections of CART-expressing enteric neurones by immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization in rat gastrointestinal (GI) tract were studied. Possible motor functions of CART were studied in vitro using longitudinal muscle strips from stomach, ileum and colon. Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide was found in numerous myenteric neurones throughout the GI tract while CART-expressing submucous neurones were scarce. Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript was also expressed in the antral gastrin cells. Myenteric CART-expressing neurones in both small and large intestine issued short descending projections. In atrophic ileum, CART mRNA-expressing neurones increased in number while neurones containing CART peptide decreased. In hypertrophied ileum, no change in CART peptide or CART mRNA containing myenteric neurones was detected. Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript 55-102 (10(-9)-10(-7) mol L-1) did not induce any contractile or relaxatory responses in the muscle strips, neither did it affect responses induced by vasoactive intestinal peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide or neuronal stimulation. In colonic, but not in ileal, strips addition of CART attenuated nitric oxide (NO) donor-induced relaxations. Although CART does not seem to play a pivotal role in classic neurotransmission to the longitudinal muscle, it may serve a modulatory role in NO transmission. It may, moreover, be involved in intestinal adaptation, and an additional hormonal role is also possible.  
PMID:11788740	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Severe impairment in grammar does not preclude theory of mind.	Debates about the role of language in human thinking are increasingly prominent in the cognitive sciences. There are claims that certain forms of reasoning can only be performed through access to the resources of the language faculty. In particular, a component of social cognition involving the representation of the mental states of others ('theory of mind' reasoning) has been claimed necessarily to involve propositions of natural language. A recent case study reported a man (SA) with severe agrammatic aphasia who was unable to understand or produce language propositions in any modality of language use, but who was able to complete theory of mind tasks. We report a replication of this finding using a modified picture theory of mind task with a second patient (MR). Despite severe aphasia and impaired performance on a test of executive function, MR demonstrated retained theory of mind reasoning. These results reveal the functional autonomy of theory of mind from the capacity for propositional/grammatical language, and support its independence from executive function.  
PMID:1373471	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Adhesion in skeletal muscle during regeneration.	Adhesion molecules were studied in regenerating skeletal muscle immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally after a standardized trauma. In normal muscle, extracellular matrix (ECM) protein tenascin was restricted to myotendinous junctions (MTJ), while the integrin beta 1-subunit was present also on the sarcolemma. After injury, tenascin increased on the outer surface of regenerating myofibers, where cellular fibronectin also accumulated. Later, tenascin concentrated at the tips of regenerating myofibers, where new MTJs were formed. The beta 1-subunit disappeared on necrotized myofibers and reappeared on regenerating fibers in a thicker layer. The regenerating myofibers were invested by a basal lamina, except for the growth cones at the distal ends, which were laminin-negative until the formation of MTJs occurred. These results indicate that regenerating muscle cells are attached to the ECM in a way that allows both growth of the muscle cells across the scar and their use before the regeneration is completed.  
PMID:1307956	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	[A comprehensive analysis of osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma and chondrosarcoma of the jaws].	The clinical, pathological and radiographic materials of 99 cases with osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma and chondrosarcoma of the jaws were analyzed comprehensively. Neither obvious differences of age, sex, duration, location of tumor, clinical symptoms and five-year survivals nor radiographic characteristics were found between these three types of sarcoma. The tumor stage and destruction of cortical bone by the tumor are the important factors influencing the prognosis of the patients. The radiographic findings are valuable for the estimation of prognosis.  
PMID:9665973	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Expression of the extracellular domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope protein and its fusion with beta-galactosidase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Two envelope glycoprotein gene fragments were cloned from the proviral genome of the HXB2 isolate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For the production of the two domains of the envelope gene product these cloned gene fragments were inserted into an Escherichia coli-yeast inducible shuttle vector fused to the galactokinase (GAL1) promoter. Cell extracts from strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring these two vectors (pYENV1 and pYENV2) were found to contain a specific protein with a size of 50 kDa when induced by galactose, while the protein could not be detected in extracts from control cells containing only the E. coli-yeast vector in the presence of galactose. Furthermore, another expression plasmid coding for fusion proteins from the majority of the external envelope glycoprotein (gp120) moiety and a large part of the beta-galactosidase was constructed. Antibodies from HIV type 1-positive sera could react with recombinant fusion polypeptides. Transformants could produce this fusion protein to a level of about 1.6% of the total protein content, as deduced from beta-galactosidase activity.

PMID:8460453	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Incidence and clinical features of renal tubular acidosis-1 in urolithiasis.	To elucidate the frequency and clinical picture of renal tubular acidosis-1 (RTA-1) in nephrolithiasis, the acid-loading test was performed in 474 patients with calcium-containing stones. RTA-1 was detected in a total of 11 patients (6 men and 5 women, 2.3%). The incidence of RTA-1 in female patients tended to be higher than in male patients (3.2 vs. 1.9%). One male patient had the complete form, the others had incomplete form. There was a tendency that RTA-1 patients were younger than non-RTA-1 patients in men, and the former were older than the latter in women. The percentages of positive family history and positive past history were 27 and 45%, respectively. Stones were single in 7 cases and multiple in 4 cases. They were unilateral in 10 cases, and bilateral in 1 case. Hypercalciuria was detected in 2 of the 11 cases, hyperuricosuria was present in none of the 11 cases, and hyperoxaluria in 2 of 8 cases examined. Stones were composed of calcium oxalate in 2 cases, calcium phosphate in 2, and calcium oxalate mixed with calcium phosphate in 3.  
PMID:2172202	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Effects of exercise on insulin-induced hypoglycemia.	The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of exercise on the rate of onset of hypoglycemia induced by infusion of excess insulin (0.8 mU.min-1.100 g-1). Rats were either fasted overnight (FS) or fed ad libitum (FD). FS rats were killed after 5, 10, or 15 min of infusion at rest or after running on the treadmill at 21 m/min and 15% grade. FD rats were killed after 10, 20, or 40 min of infusion at rest or after exercise. Rats were also killed 15 min postexercise for FS and 60 or 120 min postexercise for FD with continued insulin infusion. The progressive decline in blood glucose was not altered by exercise in the FS rats. FD rats showed a significant difference due to exercise only after 40 min (rest 4.2 +/- 0.3 mM, exercise 3.2 +/- 0.2 mM). A significant postexercise repletion of glycogen was observed in red vastus and soleus muscles of FD rats despite the decreasing blood glucose values. These data indicate that exercise accelerates the rate of development of hypoglycemia in FD rats. In the FS rats, where the rate of decline in blood glucose was greater, exercise had no effect on the time course of development of hypoglycemia.

PMID:27918550	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Selective Y centromere inactivation triggers chromosome shattering in micronuclei and repair by non-homologous end joining.	Chromosome missegregation into a micronucleus can cause complex and localized genomic rearrangements known as chromothripsis, but the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. Here we developed an inducible Y centromere-selective inactivation strategy by exploiting a CENP-A/histone H3 chimaera to directly examine the fate of missegregated chromosomes in otherwise diploid human cells. Using this approach, we identified a temporal cascade of events that are initiated following centromere inactivation involving chromosome missegregation, fragmentation, and re-ligation that span three consecutive cell cycles. Following centromere inactivation, a micronucleus harbouring the Y chromosome is formed in the first cell cycle. Chromosome shattering, producing up to 53 dispersed fragments from a single chromosome, is triggered by premature micronuclear condensation prior to or during mitotic entry of the second cycle. Lastly, canonical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), but not homology-dependent repair, is shown to facilitate re-ligation of chromosomal fragments in the third cycle. Thus, initial errors in cell division can provoke further genomic instability through fragmentation of micronuclear DNAs coupled to NHEJ-mediated reassembly in the subsequent interphase.

PMID:24513213	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	GPRC5B a putative glutamate-receptor candidate is negative modulator of insulin secretion.	GPRC5B is an orphan receptor belonging to the group C family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPRC5B is abundantly expressed in both human and mouse pancreatic islets, and both GPRC5B mRNA and protein are up-regulated 2.5-fold in islets from organ donors with type 2 diabetes. Expression of Gprc5b is 50% lower in islets isolated from newborn (<3 weeks) than in adult (>36 weeks) mice. Lentiviral shRNA-mediated down-regulation of Gprc5b in intact islets from 12-16 week old mice strongly (2.5-fold) increased basal (1 mmol/l) and moderately (40%) potentiated glucose-(20 mmol/l) stimulated insulin secretion and also enhanced the potentiating effect of glutamate on insulin secretion. Down-regulation of Gprc5b protected murine insulin-secreting clonal MIN6 cells against cytokine-induced apoptosis. We propose that increased expression of GPRC5B contributes to the reduced insulin secretion and beta-cell viability observed in type-2 diabetes. Thus, pharmacological targeting of GPRC5B might provide a novel means therapy for the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes.

PMID:9261336	<AUTHORS>	<JOURNAL>	<YEAR>	Effect of neutrophil serine proteinases and defensins on lung epithelial cells: modulation of cytotoxicity and IL-8 production.	Neutrophil accumulation in the lung may contribute to tissue injury as observed in inflammatory diseases. Both oxidative and non-oxidative mechanisms are involved in neutrophil-mediated tissue injury. Non-oxidative mechanisms include the release of neutrophil granule proteins such as the serine proteinases elastase and cathepsin G, and the non-enzymatic defensins. Because stimulated neutrophils are thought to release their products simultaneously, we investigated possible interactions between purified defensins and serine proteinases with respect to induction of cellular injury and their ability to induce interleukin-8 (IL-8) synthesis in cells of the lung epithelial cell line A549. Whereas defensins induced cell lysis, elastase and cathepsin G induced detachment of A549 cells. Co-incubation of elastase and cathepsin G revealed an additive effect on detachment, whereas defensins inhibited serine proteinase-induced detachment. Vice versa, both serine proteinases reduced defensin-induced cell lysis. Furthermore, elastase and cathepsin G prevented defensin-induced IL-8 synthesis. In contrast, no inhibitory interaction between cathepsin G and defensins was observed with respect to their antibacterial activity. The results from this study indicate that, at sites of inflammation, neutrophil-mediated injury might be regulated by interactions between released defensins and serine proteinases.
